### Problem
You have a five quart jug and a three quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). 
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
NOTE: The jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly ‘half’ of the jug would be impossible.

### SOLUTION
We can pour water back and forth between the two jugs as follows:

| 5 Quart Contents | 3 Quart Contents | 
| :---: | :---: | 
|5 | 0| 
|2| 3|
|0| 2|
|5| 2|
|4|3|
Done! We have four quarts.
